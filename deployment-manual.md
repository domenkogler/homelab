# deployment-manual.md — Redeployment Runbook (True Zero → Live)

> **Role:** Imperative, phase-by-phase **procedure** for redeploying the homelab from true zero —
> exact commands, panel settings, and the verification evidence each step must produce before the
> next step runs. Deliberately free of progress markers and fix history: progress checkboxes live in
> [deployment-tasks.md](deployment-tasks.md) (ledger), execution history in
> [deployment-journal.md](deployment-journal.md) (as-built), desired-state specs in the owning
> `docs/*.md`. If reality diverges permanently, fix the procedure here (or the owning spec) in the
> same change and journal the event.
> **Linked from:** [docs/index.md](docs/index.md), [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md),

## How to use

- Execute phases in order. Every step ends with a ✔-evidence check — do not proceed past red.
- Binding working rules: `bash scripts/validate-all.sh` green before every commit; secrets by
  1Password item+field name only (never values); every executed action gets a journal entry
  (raw notes → the DATA feed in [prompt-journal.md](prompt-journal.md)).
- Shells: repo ops + validators from **git-bash** (Windows laptop); Ansible runs ONLY on the
  **WSL Debian runner** through [scripts/ansible-run.sh](scripts/README.md) — never pass inline
  commands to wsl.exe.
- ⚠ **9P staleness — mandatory sync gate before ANY playbook run (HD-212, decided 2026-08-23):** the
  runner reads the repo over `/mnt/d`; Windows-side writes can be served stale to WSL for minutes.
  1. Whole-tree compare from the repo root on BOTH sides — must be equal:
     `git ls-files -z | xargs -0 md5sum | md5sum`
  2. Mismatch → force-invalidate, re-hash after each:
     `wsl -d Debian -u root -- bash -c 'echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'`; still stale → inside WSL
     `sudo umount /mnt/d && sudo mount -t drvfs D: /mnt/d`.
  3. Both fail to clear → migrate the runner clone natively into WSL (pre-authorized, no re-ask).
- Quick turnover while iterating on a failing step: re-run from a named task —
  `bash scripts/ansible-run.sh playbooks/<playbook>.yml --start-at-task="<task name>"`.
  (Per-role `--tags` need role tags in the playbook — none exist today except `wireguard`.)

## Phase 0 — Management runner (WSL Debian) from true zero

> Rebuilds the Ansible control node on the management laptop. Owning specs:
> [docs/1password.md](docs/1password.md) (runner auth + agent), [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md)
> (runner tooling).
> **Prerequisites (vault `Homelab-ansible`):** items `op_api` (field `credential`),
> `laptop-domen_ssh`, `ansible-admin_ssh`, `ai_ssh`, `kopia_password` exist.

### 0.1 (Re-)install the WSL Debian distro `[MANUAL]`

```powershell
wsl --unregister Debian    # destructive — wipes the current runner; deliberate rebuilds only
wsl --install -d Debian
```

Create the local user `domen`, then set its password (`passwd`) and store it as item
`laptop-domen-wsl-debian_login` (field `password`) in the **Homelab** 1Password vault.
The repo is **reused** from the Windows checkout at
`/mnt/d/source/domenkogler/homelab` (single working copy — no second clone inside WSL).

✔ `wsl -l -v` lists Debian; inside WSL `whoami` → `domen`.

### 0.2 Bootstrap tooling, service-account token, sudo

```bash
cd /mnt/d/source/domenkogler/homelab/IaC/bootstrap-ansible-client && bash bootstrap.sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

When prompted, paste the 1Password Service Account token = item `op_api.credential`. The idempotent
script installs system prerequisites + the `op` CLI, creates the `~/ansible-venv` virtualenv with
ansible + collections from `requirements.yml`, stores the token at `~/.config/op/homelab-sa-token`
(0600), grants passwordless sudo, and generates a throwaway SSH key.

✔ Script prints `FULL BOOTSTRAP COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY`; `ansible --version` and `op --version` respond.

### 0.3 Canonical runner identity + 1Password/Ansible connectivity check

```bash
cd /mnt/d/source/domenkogler/homelab && bash scripts/restore-runner-key.sh
bash scripts/ansible-run.sh IaC/ansible/test-1password.yml
```

`restore-runner-key.sh` pulls `ansible-admin_ssh.private_key` / `public_key` from the vault into
`~/.ssh/id_ed25519[.pub]` (bootstrap's throwaway key is discarded — the vault is the source of
truth); `test-1password.yml` then proves the lookup path end-to-end.

✔ `restore-runner-key.sh` prints `pair-consistent: yes` with the fingerprint matching the canonical
one it prints · `test-1password.yml` ends `PLAY RECAP: ok=2 failed=0` (reads `kopia_password`).

### 0.4 Windows-side interactive SSH *(one-time, recommended — not required by the runner)*

> Nothing automated depends on this step: the Ansible runner (WSL) presents the canonical
> `ansible-admin_ssh` key directly, and interactive debugging also works from WSL
> (`ssh ansible-admin@vps.kogler.si`, full sudo). Recommended anyway — `ssh vps` from the laptop is
> the standing debug path (deployment-handoff diagnostics) and stays available while the WSL runner
> itself is down or being rebuilt.

1. 1Password desktop app running, with the `Homelab-ansible` vault allowlisted in the SSH-agent
   config — without it the agent refuses the keys and `ssh` misreports `invalid format`.
2. `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\config` gets two aliases differing only by presented key:

```ssh-config
Host vps-ansible   # runner identity (ansible-admin_ssh)
  HostName vps.kogler.si
  User ansible-admin
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ansible-admin_ssh.pub
  IdentitiesOnly yes

Host vps           # personal interactive identity (laptop-domen_ssh)
  HostName vps.kogler.si
  User ansible-admin
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/laptop-domen_ssh.pub
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```

The `.pub` files are hints for the 1Password agent, not key copies. Item names are vault identities —
there is no `domen` account on managed hosts.

✔ Once a provisioned host exists (Phase 0.5): `ssh vps whoami` and `ssh vps-ansible whoami` both
return `ansible-admin` with no password prompt.

---

## Phase 0.5 — VPS (re-)provisioning (netcup SCP)

> Maps to [deployment-tasks.md](deployment-tasks.md) Phase 1 step 1. Authoring spec for the install
> scripts/media: [docs/deployment-preseed.md](docs/deployment-preseed.md).
> **Prerequisites:** Phase 0 green; vault fields `laptop-domen_ssh.public_key` +
> `ansible-admin_ssh.public_key` readable by the runner.

### 0.5.1 Generate the Custom Script

On the WSL runner (working `op` session):

```bash
cd IaC/host/vps && ./gen-custom-script.sh
```

Builds the git-ignored `post_install_with_secrets.sh` (0600): injects both real public keys into a
copy of `post_install.sh`, then self-checks placeholders replaced, no doubled algorithm prefix
(HD-209 guard), `bash -n` syntax.

✔ `✔ post_install_with_secrets.sh written (0600, placeholders injected, syntax OK).`

### 0.5.2 netcup SCP — reinstall settings `[MANUAL]`

In the netcup SCP, open the server's image-delivery / reinstall dialog and set exactly:

| netcup SCP field | Value |
|---|---|
| Official image | **Debian 13.6.0 UEFI amd64** (current Debian 13 UEFI amd64 at reinstall time) |
| Installation method | **Minimal** — Minimal image |
| Partitioning | one large OS partition using **all available disk space** (plain partitions, no LVM) |
| Hostname | `vps` |
| Locale | `en_US.UTF-8` (`sl_SI.UTF-8` is set by the Ansible `common` role on first run) |
| Timezone | `Europe/Vienna` |
| Create additional user | **false** — the Custom Script creates `ansible-admin` |
| Send e-mail to me | **true** — the finish notification carries the host-key report used below |
| Custom Script | **full content** of the generated `post_install_with_secrets.sh` |
| Root password (fallback) | set — break-glass console recovery only |

After pasting: **delete** the generated file — `rm -- post_install_with_secrets.sh` (never commit it;
committed `post_install.sh` stays placeholder-only, keys never in Git).

### 0.5.3 First-boot verification

Reinstall rotates the host keys — capture them fresh and pin against the netcup install report (TOFU):

```bash
ssh-keygen -R vps.kogler.si
ssh-keyscan -4 -t ed25519,ecdsa,rsa vps.kogler.si | ssh-keygen -lf -
# compare the three fingerprints with the install-report e-mail, then:
ssh vps whoami && ssh vps hostname
ssh vps 'sudo sshd -T | grep -E "^(passwordauthentication|permitrootlogin|maxauthtries)"'
ssh vps 'ls /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/'
ssh vps 'sudo cat /etc/sudoers.d/ansible-admin'
ssh vps 'awk "{print \$NF}" ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
```

✔ Evidence: three fingerprints match the report · `ansible-admin` / `vps` ·
`passwordauthentication no` + `permitrootlogin no` + `maxauthtries 3` (from the hardening drop-in
alone) · `00-homelab-hardening.conf` present · `NOPASSWD:ALL` sudoers · exactly two authorized keys
(comments `admin@laptop` and `ansible`).

> **Break-glass:** locked out → netcup SCP **console** as root; the fallback password is item
> `netcup-vps_login` (owner's personal Homelab vault — invisible to the automation service account).
> Reusable recovery patterns from past incidents: authorized_keys repair (journal Phase 1.0,
> HD-209) and `nft flush ruleset` for a deploy-induced firewall lockout (journal Phase 1).

## Phase 1 — Deploy the VPS service stack *(section stub)*

> **To be written after the first fully green Phase 1 Verify block**
> ([deployment-tasks.md](deployment-tasks.md)) so the runbook captures the settled path, not the
> current halt. Planned coverage: vault coverage check + seeding
> ([scripts/check-vault-items.sh](scripts/README.md), [scripts/provision-vault.sh](scripts/README.md))
> → `bash scripts/ansible-run.sh playbooks/vps.yml` → the Verify-block evidence commands →
> deploy-gated row ticks.
>
> Known updates expected to land first: rotate the chat-exposed `authentik-provision_api` service
> account + replace the placeholder API-key items (HD-211); HD-212 (native WSL clone) would change
> §Phase 0 — update this runbook in the same change if adopted.
