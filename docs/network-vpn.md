## Two Layers, Two Subnet Families

| Layer | Technology | Endpoint | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Site-to-Site** | WireGuard (native RouterOS) | RB4011 ↔ VPS, port 51820 | Home LAN ↔ VPS services, always on |
| **Mobile Mesh** | **Headscale** (self-hosted Tailscale) | Home server Docker | Family phones/devices — easier app, wife-friendly |

> **Strategy:** WireGuard is **site-to-site only**. User devices use Headscale.
> The old WireGuard road-warrior endpoint and the travel router were **removed** —
> Headscale fully replaces them.

### Reserved Subnets

| Family | Name (see SSOT) | Allocations |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **WireGuard / tunnel** | `wireguard` | `wg-s2s` link (home `.1` ↔ VPS `.2`) · `wg-vps-services` (VPS services) · `wg-vps-dmz` (VPS DMZ) · `wg-vps-lab` (VPS lab) |
| **Headscale overlay** | `headscale` | CGNAT (Tailscale-compatible) — router routes this to Home LAN |
| **Home LAN** | `site` | VLANs `10.10.x.0/24` (see `network-vlans.md`) |

All concrete CIDRs: [`network-addresses-generated.md`](network-addresses-generated.md) → *Infrastructure networks* (SSOT).

## Layer 1: WireGuard Site-to-Site (Home ↔ VPS)

- **Home RB4011:** `wg-s2s` peer `.1`
- **VPS WireGuard endpoint:** `wg-s2s` peer `.2`
- Always on, no on-demand
- Home router: static route `wg-vps-services` → via the VPS S2S peer
- VPS: route `site` → via the home S2S peer

> **Least-access (HD-155):** the VPS S2S peer's **AllowedIPs** (both sides) cover **only** the scoped home targets —
> `nas` (nut:9199 / zfs:9198), `ha-vip` (HA:8123), `oldsrv` + `pi` (probes / app backends when wired), `router`/`switch`
> (ICMP) — **not** the whole `site` /16. The RB4011 additionally enforces a forward ACL (`vps_s2s_peer` →
> `vps_scoped_home` accept, else drop). See [`security.md`](security.md) §9.

## Layer 2: Headscale (Mobile Mesh)

- Runs on the **VPS** as a Docker container (HD-135: public coordination server, VPS residency)
- Overlay subnet: `headscale` (CIDR per SSOT)
- Clients: Android/iOS Tailscale app, laptops
- **Home RB4011:** static route + firewall rules so the Headscale overlay reaches the Home VLAN
- **VPS:** routes the home `site` + `wg-vps-services` over the S2S tunnel to reach home resources
- Mesh clients → VPS Headscale (public, its purpose) → over S2S → home LAN; each node has an ACL-gated path home
- **Registration & ACL (HD-84 / KOPS-022):** OIDC-authenticated clients are **auto-approved** by
  Headscale (no separate registration gate in `config.yaml`). The traffic boundary is therefore a **real
  ACL policy** (`policy.hujson`, rendered alongside `config.yaml`): only nodes carrying the admin-applied
  `tag:kogler` may reach the family mesh (`tag:kogler:*`), and only the mesh admin (`autogroup:admin`)
  can apply that tag. Untagged / rogue auto-joined nodes are denied by default.

### Transition
1. Deploy Headscale on the VPS (public edge; remote nodes reach it directly)
2. Family installs the Tailscale app (one-by-one migration from the removed road-warrior / travel-router paths)
3. WireGuard road-warrior and the travel router are **gone** — no fallback surface to maintain

## Family Usage Scenarios

| Situation | How to Connect |
|-----------|---------------|
| **At home** | "Kogler" SSID, `kogler.si` dashboard |
| **Traveling** | Tailscale app → tap Connect (mobile mesh) |
| **Remote (anywhere)** | Tailscale → access Immich, OpenCloud, HA |
| **Office MCP bridges (Windows clients)** | Expose the per-client **Office MCP server** over the Headscale interface only (token-auth, no public) so a server-side **Open WebUI** can call Word/Excel/PowerPoint tools. See [`llm-office.md`](llm-office.md) (HD-106–111). |
