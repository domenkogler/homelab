## Two Layers, Two Subnet Families

| Layer | Technology | Endpoint | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Site-to-Site** | WireGuard (native RouterOS) | RB4011 ↔ VPS, port 51820 | Home LAN ↔ VPS services, always on |
| **Mobile Mesh** | **Headscale** (self-hosted Tailscale) | Home server Docker | Family phones/devices — easier app, wife-friendly |

> **Strategy:** WireGuard is **site-to-site only**. User devices use Headscale.
> The old WireGuard road-warrior endpoint and the travel router were **removed** —
> Headscale fully replaces them.

### Reserved Subnets

| Family | Name (see SSOT) | Allocations |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **WireGuard / tunnel** | `wireguard` | `wg-s2s` link (home `.1` ↔ VPS `.2`) · `wg-vps-services` (VPS services) · `wg-vps-dmz` (VPS DMZ) · `wg-vps-lab` (VPS lab) |
| **Headscale overlay** | `headscale` | CGNAT (Tailscale-compatible) — router routes this to Home LAN |
| **Home LAN** | `site` | VLANs `10.10.x.0/24` (see `network-vlans.md`) |

All concrete CIDRs: [`network-addresses.md`](network-addresses.md) → *Infrastructure networks* (SSOT).

## Layer 1: WireGuard Site-to-Site (Home ↔ VPS)

- **Home RB4011:** `wg-s2s` peer `.1`
- **VPS WireGuard endpoint:** `wg-s2s` peer `.2`
- Always on, no on-demand
- Home router: static route `wg-vps-services` → via the VPS S2S peer
- VPS: route `site` → via the home S2S peer

## Layer 2: Headscale (Mobile Mesh)

- Runs on home server as Docker container
- Overlay subnet: `headscale` (CIDR per SSOT)
- Clients: Android/iOS Tailscale app, laptops
- On RB4011: static route + firewall rules so the Headscale overlay reaches the Home VLAN
- Headscale traffic to VPS goes through the site-to-site WireGuard tunnel

### Transition
1. Deploy Headscale on home server
2. Family installs the Tailscale app (one-by-one migration from the removed road-warrior / travel-router paths)
3. WireGuard road-warrior and the travel router are **gone** — no fallback surface to maintain

## Family Usage Scenarios

| Situation | How to Connect |
|-----------|---------------|
| **At home** | "Kogler" SSID, `kogler.si` dashboard |
| **Traveling** | Tailscale app → tap Connect (mobile mesh) |
| **Remote (anywhere)** | Tailscale → access Immich, OpenCloud, HA |
| **Office MCP bridges (Windows clients)** | Expose the per-client **Office MCP server** over the Headscale interface only (token-auth, no public) so a server-side **Open WebUI** can call Word/Excel/PowerPoint tools. See [`llm-office.md`](llm-office.md) (HD-106–111). |
