## Architecture

```
Alloy (host agent: metrics + logs + SNMP, has docker.sock)
   ├─ remote_write ──▶ Prometheus  (THE metrics store, 30d)
   └─ push ──────────▶ Loki        (logs, 14d)
Dozzle (read-only docker.sock) ─────▶ live per-container log tail (ops, no storage)
Home Assistant (SWO-B + ComfoAir) ──Prometheus exporter──▶ Prometheus
MikroTik (SNMP, 5–15s poll) ─────────────────────────────▶ Prometheus
blackbox_exporter (external reachability) ───────────────▶ Prometheus  (probe_success)
nut_exporter (UPS, on nas) ──────────────────────────────▶ Prometheus  (battery/runtime/voltage)

                        Prometheus ──▶ Grafana (stats.kogler.si, internal, Authentik admin-only)
                                          │  webhook
                                          ▼
                                        n8n (alert router: dedup / tier / format)
                                          ├──▶ signal-cli → Signal "Homelab Alerts" group
                                          └──▶ SMTP → email
                               Grafana-native SMTP = fail-safe, parallel
```

- **Single source of truth** for every type of data; no redundant backends.
- **Display:** Grafana (admin analytics) + Homepage (status widget — reachability eyeball view).
- **Removed from earlier drafts:** InfluxDB, Telegraf, Promtail, Uptime Kuma — none are used.

## Alerting

- **Engine:** Grafana Unified Alerting (rules live with the data; no separate Alertmanager).
- **Router:** alerts → n8n webhook → normalize / dedup / tier / format → Signal + email. n8n also serves office automation ([`llm-office.md`](llm-office.md)).
- **Webhook:** Grafana's contact point posts to `grafana_alert_webhook_url` (group_var, default `http://n8n:5678/webhook/homelab-alerts`, traefik-public). ⚠ The n8n workflow **`homelab-alerts`** on that route must exist before the first alert fires (created at n8n setup; payload = Grafana alert-notification webhook, see the monitoring role `grafana-contactpoints.yml.j2`).
- **Fail-safe:** Grafana-native SMTP contact point runs in parallel — alerts still go out if n8n/signal-cli is down.
- **Signal:** `signal-cli-rest-api` container, **linked** to Domen's personal number (no second SIM), sends to a dedicated **"Homelab Alerts"** group. Persist the Signal identity volume so it doesn't need re-linking.

### Tiers

| Severity | What alerts | Channel | Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Critical** | oldsrv disk ≥90%, **nas ZFS pool usage ≥80% (`tank` & `bulk`)**, host down, ZFS pool degraded, service down >2min, `probe_success==0` · **UPS battery <20% or runtime <5 min (impending shutdown)** | Signal + email | page-worthy |
| **Warning** | container restart loop, high CPU/load, HA unreachable, MikroTik link down, **nas pool ≥70%** · **UPS on-battery / mains lost (auto-clear on return)** | Signal (deduped) | sent once |
| **Info** | transient / everything else · **UPS online ↔ on-battery transitions / restored** | logged only | no push |

- **Poke/throttle:** re-send only if still firing after ~30 min (prevents overnight alert floods).
- **Self-monitoring:** the observability stack itself (Prometheus/Loki/n8n down) must alert — otherwise the alert channel dies silently.

---

## UPS / Power-Loss Monitoring (NUT)

- **Metrics (single source):** one **nut_exporter** on **nas** (the NUT master) reads local `upsd` → Prometheus. Other hosts do **not** re-export identical UPS data (avoids redundancy).
- **Shutdown:** **NUT owns local shutdown** on `nas`, `oldsrv`, and `ha` (Raspberry Pi). Grafana/n8n are **alert-only** — there is **no shutdown action from Grafana** (observability lives on oldsrv, which must not be the thing that halts the NAS during a power cut).
- **Notification ordering & delay:** on mains loss the **Warning "on-battery" alerts at t=0** (WAN still up via router/ONT on UPS → Signal + email deliver). At **Critical**, `oldsrv` is **delayed ~60 s** before powerdown (via NUT `upssched`) so its own Grafana→n8n→Signal/email pipeline flushes the Critical alert, then it powers off. `nas` + `ha` power down immediately.
- **Guaranteed fallback:** a **NUT-side `notifycmd`/`upssched-cmd` script on nas** emails + sends Signal directly on `ONBATT` and `LOWBATT`, independent of Grafana/n8n — so a pre-shutdown notification is sent even if the observability stack is already degraded.
- Registered/configured via the `nut` Ansible role — see [`deployment-ansible.md`](deployment-ansible.md).

## Microservice Notes

- **MikroTik SNMP:** poll at **5–15 s**; the "1s" in dashboards is a *refresh* interval, not a poll.
- **Retention is deliberate:** 30d metrics / 14d logs. TSDB data is **regenerable and not backed up** (see [backup.md](backup.md)); long-term metric history is a deferred option (remote-write/downsampling).
- **SPOF:** all observability lives on oldsrv — accepted for Phase 1; documented as a known property.
- **Dozzle is not a second log backend** — it streams live logs straight from the Docker API (read-only socket) and persists nothing. Loki stays the single stored-log source (14d) and Grafana the search/alert surface.
- **Pi keeps only a tiny bounded local log buffer.** The Raspberry Pi primary holds **no durable log store** — Docker uses log driver `local` (`max-size: 10m, max-file: 2`) as RAM/disk resilience when oldsrv/Loki is down; the durable, searchable copy lives in Loki. Host OS logs run on tmpfs (`journald Storage=volatile` + `/var/log` tmpfs). See [Pi SD-card wear strategy](#pi-sd-card-wear-strategy).
- **HA exporter** on the HA instance (Raspberry Pi 4 primary; cold-standby container on oldsrv — see [`smart-home-failover.md`](smart-home-failover.md)). Only the live instance is scraped (via the VIP); on failover the same URL resumes with no replay.

## Pi SD-card wear strategy

The Raspberry Pi 4 primary runs HA from a **microSD** (`storage-zfs.md`), so the dominant continuous SD-wear
source is **HA's recorder DB**, plus rolling Docker/OS logs. Strategy (HD-19, applies to the Pi; the standby on
oldsrv is on NVMe and mostly unaffected):

1. **HA recorder → trim, NOT disable.** Grafana (central Prometheus, 30d) replaces HA for *long-term analytics*,
   so raw state history can be short: `recorder: { purge_keep_days: 1–2, commit_interval: 2–5, … }` plus
   `exclude:` for noisy domains you only need in Grafana. Keeping the recorder **enabled** is deliberate — it still
   powers the **Logbook**, the **Energy Dashboard (long-term-statistics tables)** (e.g. KNX appliance-current
   sensors → kWh), **`history_stats` / `history()` templates**, and per-entity short-term UI sparklines, none of
   which Grafana covers. LTS writes are hourly min/max/mean per entity — negligible SD cost. **Do NOT disable** the
   recorder, and do NOT move HA to Postgres (worse microSD wear + failover coupling — see `smart-home.md`).
2. **Docker container logs → stream + bounded local buffer.** Docker log driver `local`, `max-size: 10m, max-file: 2`
   on the Pi (and standby): small RAM/disk buffer survives an oldsrv/Loki outage, while **Alloy ships logs → Loki
   (14d, oldsrv NVMe)** and Dozzle streams live — no durable on-Pi log store.
3. **OS logs off the SD.** `journald Storage=volatile` + `/var/log` mounted as tmpfs (fstab) — host OS logs live in
   RAM, lost on reboot (acceptable; Loki retains the useful logs). Cheap, well-tested Pi-SD saver.
4. *(Optional)* **Docker *log* directory on tmpfs** to guarantee zero *transient* SD writes — must stay hard-capped
   (`max-size`/`max-file`); **never** tmpfs the Docker data-root (`/var/lib/docker`/overlay2, that holds images &
   containers), only the log portion. Only if the 4 GB RAM budget (shared with HA/RaspberryMatic/Technitium) allows.

> Not addressed via ramdisk: the HA recorder DB and Technitium / RaspberryMatic state stay on the microSD but are
> kept small (trimmed recorder, reduced log verbosity). tmpfs-ing the recorder would throw away state/history on
> every reboot — see the energy/logbook caveats above.

## Deferred / TODOs

| Item | When | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Pi recorder trim + log strategy | after observability live (HD-19) | recorder trimmed, **not disabled** (keep Logbook/Energy-Dashboard LTS/history_stats); Pi logs → Loki + `local` driver buffer + `/var/log` tmpfs — see [Pi SD-card wear strategy](#pi-sd-card-wear-strategy)
| Long-term metric retention (remote-write, downsampling) | if ever needed | escape hatch = Thanos/VictoriaMetrics |
| Prometheus Alertmanager | only if Grafana-outage resilience demanded | Grafana Alerting covers Phase 1 |
| Homematic full-local (HmIP-RFUSB + RaspberryMatic on Pi) | redo plan | see `smart-home.md` — affects HAP/HA integration, not metrics flow |
| Container memory working-set metrics (Docker API → Prometheus) | with the *arr stack | validates the `services.md` RAM budget with real numbers, not estimates |
| **Homelable** (interactive topology/rack visualizer) | Phase 2 — once services are live | MIT · Pouzor/homelable · young project (re-evaluate maturity before adopting). Live health-check map + rack canvas w/ port patching + nmap scan + MCP server. Could replace the Obsidian `Rack.canvas` as the *live* visual and subsume the Homepage reachability widget. **Not** a metrics/logs/alert backend. · [`network-rack.md`](network-rack.md), [`todo.md`](../todo.md) |
| Route alerts to a **Matrix room** (`#homelab`) | with the Matrix stack (HD-46) | optional consolidation — alongside the Signal + SMTP fail-safe; homeserver/exporter only. · [`services-matrix.md`](services-matrix.md) |
| **MikroTik SNMP community** — Alloy collector assumes v2c `public` (monitoring role `snmp.yml.j2`) | before network deploy (HD-03) | ⚠ **needs research + decision:** choose a dedicated read-only community + mgmt-VLAN ACL vs RouterOS default `public`; then enable `/snmp` on RB4011/CRS328 (device-side, not IaC) |
| **Grafana alert-rule provisioning schema** (monitoring role `grafana-rules.yml.j2`) | first deploy of the monitoring role | ⚠ **needs live check:** query+threshold data-model + folder auto-creation unverified against a running Grafana — confirm rules load (Grafana logs) and fire once before trusting alerting |
| **Alloy host-metrics instance label** (`alloy.river.j2` scrape target `127.0.0.1:9998`) | before enabling Alloy on a 2nd host (Pi) | ⚠ **needs decision:** identical `instance` label across hosts collides in Prometheus; set per-host instance (e.g. `{{ inventory_hostname }}`) when a second Alloy host is enabled |
