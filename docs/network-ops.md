## Router Config Lifecycle

1. **Factory reset** → import the **rendered** `IaC/router/rendered/rb4011_initial.rsc` via WinBox
   (baseline) — the committed file is the TEMPLATE `IaC/router/templates/rb4011_initial.rsc.j2`;
   render it first with `playbooks/render-routeros.yml` (secrets-injected output into the gitignored
   `rendered/` dir). Never import the raw `.j2`.
2. **Ansible `router` role** takes over — all subsequent changes via REST API
3. **Optional:** after manual WinBox changes, export a snapshot as
   `IaC/router/rb4011_live.rsc` for documentation (not yet created)

Source of truth: `rb4011_initial.rsc.j2` + the `router` Ansible role. The live export is documentation-only and not required for operations.

## Service Binding & INPUT Firewall (HD-78 / HD-83)

- **Bootstrap (HD-83 / KOPS-003/042):** in `rb4011_initial.rsc.j2` every management service
  (`api`, `www-ssl`, `ssh`) is **bound to the Management VLAN interface** (`interface=vlan{mgmt}-mgmt`)
  so none listens on WAN or any other VLAN during the bootstrap window. Plain `www` (HTTP) and
  `api-ssl` (no TLS cert yet) are left disabled.
- **Bootstrap-window binding floor (B4):** EVERY bootstrap template (`rb4011`, `crs328`, `ap`) must
  bind management services to the Management interface/bridge **from the first line of device
  uptime** — the rb4011 template above is the canonical pattern; no template may enable an unbound
  management service. The crs328/ap templates are aligned to this floor by **HD-193** before the
  Phase 1.5 cutover.
- **Steady-state INPUT chain (HD-78 / KOPS-003/009):** Ansible router role adds `chain: input` rules so
  the management service ports (`22,8728,8729,8291,80,443`) are reachable **only from the Management
  VLAN (99) and `trusted-admin` hosts** (nas/oldsrv/ha-vip); the ports are dropped from every other
  source. Established/related and DHCP input remain accepted so the control plane, clients and the
  deferred WireGuard/VRRP links keep working.
- **Assert-before-mutate (HD-161):** both the router and switch Ansible roles start with a `community.routeros.api_facts` read of `/system identity` and assert the target matches the per-gear `routeros_expected_identity` from `group_vars/` (fail-loud — a blank identity aborts). This runs **once per role run**, before any `api_modify`, so a wrong-target or swapped-host can never receive config meant for another device.
- **Router API TLS (HD-161 Part B):** the management API is moved to **`api-ssl` (:8729) with a self-signed device cert** and `validate_certs: false` in Ansible — TLS encryption on a private Mgmt-VLAN link, **no public CA / no Let's Encrypt dependency**. Enabled via the role (cert creation + `api-ssl` enable), then plaintext `api` (:8728) retired by a manual WinBox cutover. See `rb4011_initial.rsc.j2` / `crs328_initial.rsc.j2`.
- **Shared RouterOS admin credential (HD-165):** because all management binds to Mgmt-VLAN 99 (above), the **same `mikrotik-admin_login` password is deliberately shared** across RB4011 + CRS328 + APs as an **accepted** risk — it cannot be reached from WAN or any non-Mgmt VLAN. Revisit per-gear items only if a device gains WAN-exposed management or this ACL changes. See [deployment-secrets.md](deployment-secrets.md).
