## Router Config Lifecycle

1. **Factory reset** → import `IaC/router/rb4011_initial.rsc` via WinBox (baseline)
2. **Ansible `router` role** takes over — all subsequent changes via REST API
3. **Optional:** after manual WinBox changes, export a snapshot as
   `IaC/router/rb4011_live.rsc` for documentation (not yet created)

Source of truth: `rb4011_initial.rsc` + the `router` Ansible role. The live export is documentation-only and not required for operations.

## Service Binding & INPUT Firewall (HD-78 / HD-83)

- **Bootstrap (HD-83 / KOPS-003/042):** in `rb4011_initial.rsc.j2` every management service
  (`api`, `www-ssl`, `ssh`) is **bound to the Management VLAN interface** (`interface=vlan{mgmt}-mgmt`)
  so none listens on WAN or any other VLAN during the bootstrap window. Plain `www` (HTTP) and
  `api-ssl` (no TLS cert yet) are left disabled.
- **Steady-state INPUT chain (HD-78 / KOPS-003/009):** Ansible router role adds `chain: input` rules so
  the management service ports (`22,8728,8729,8291,80,443`) are reachable **only from the Management
  VLAN (99) and `trusted-admin` hosts** (nas/oldsrv/ha-vip); the ports are dropped from every other
  source. Established/related and DHCP input remain accepted so the control plane, clients and the
  deferred WireGuard/VRRP links keep working.
- **Shared RouterOS admin credential (HD-165):** because all management binds to Mgmt-VLAN 99 (above), the **same `mikrotik-admin_login` password is deliberately shared** across RB4011 + CRS328 + APs as an **accepted** risk — it cannot be reached from WAN or any non-Mgmt VLAN. Revisit per-gear items only if a device gains WAN-exposed management or this ACL changes. See [deployment-secrets.md](deployment-secrets.md).
